Pulp fiction is interesting case study. 3 different films. Doesn't follow conventional rules

to do 
- Find Theory plot points for tooltip [10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 88%]
- add up and down arrows to communicate above or below avg in moment table
- legend!!
- add other film info topics from working movies excel (budget, release date, studio, tagline?)
- add/update readme!!
- add more movies

ideas
- encode revenue? rating? etc
