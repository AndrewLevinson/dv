Fox) meets Doc Brown (Christopher Loyd) at the Twin Pines Mall at 1:15 AM to help him conduct an experiment involving a tricked-out DeLorean. When the DeLorean carrying Doc's dog Einstein disintegrates in a flash of lighting, flames shooting between their legs, Doc is ecstatic shouting, “Eighty-eight miles per hour!” Marty can only look on in horror thinking that Doc has killed Einstein. He soon learns, though, that Doc has just invented time travel.",23,"Doc prepares to travel into the future, but Libyan terrorists arrive seeking revenge for the plutonium Doc stole from them.

Luckily, George reclaims his future bride and kisses her, thereby saving Marty and his siblings. ",86,"Marty arrives in 1985, hoping that he will somehow be able to save Doc from the terrorists, but he’s too late, and can only sit weeping next to his fallen friend bemoaning the fact that if Doc hadn't torn up the letter Marty had given him in 1955, he might have lived. As luck would have it, Doc wakes up, revealing that he is wearing a bulletproof vest. To Marty's astonishment, Doc hands him a taped-up copy of the letter. When Marty asks him why he would risk screwing up the future, Doc smiles impishly and says, “Well, I figured, what the hell.”",105,116

Willard and Lance get off the boat to have a look around. On their walk, it becomes increasingly clear that no one is in charge of this outpost; every night Charlie blows up the bridge, the U.S. military rebuilds it just to say “the road is open.” Chief Phillips (Albert Hall), the boat’s captain, asks Willard once more which way to go, and they all continue further up the river.",104,"Finally, Willard explains his mission to the only two remaining crew members of the boat; Lance and Jay ‘Chef’ Hicks (Frederic Forrest), and the very next day they arrive at their destination.
